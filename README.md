# ImgScribe

ImgScribe â€” A Smart Image Caption Generator using BLIP

Objective:
To build a deep learning application that automatically generates meaningful captions for images using a pretrained BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model and the Flickr8k dataset. The model is trained and deployed with an aesthetically enhanced Streamlit GUI.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Dataset: Flickr8k (Images + Captions)
Model: Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base (Pretrained)
Frameworks/Libraries:
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
scikit-learn
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Streamlit
Device: GPU (8GB VRAM) using CUDA
Interface: Streamlit GUI (Dark Themed)

Features:
Uses BLIP model with vision-language pretraining
Fine-tuned on Flickr8k with ~6000 samples
Custom PyTorch Dataset for handling captions and images
GPU-accelerated training with memory optimization
Image caption generation using GUI
Streamlit-based dark-themed interface
Fully offline and local deployment possible

model.py Summary:
Loads and preprocesses dataset
Uses Hugging Face Trainer for training
Optimized for GPU with memory tweaks (expandable segments, lower max_length, batch size = 1)
Trains and saves BLIP model locally

app.py Summary (GUI):
Allows uploading of image files (.jpg/.png)
Preprocesses image and generates caption using the trained BLIP model
Modern UI using Streamlit with dark theme
Display of image and predicted caption

How to Run:
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (optional if model is already trained):

python model.py
ðŸ’» Run the app:
streamlit run app.py

Deployment Notes:
Can be hosted locally (http://localhost:8501)
To expose via HTTPS:
Use services like ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel
Or deploy on platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or Vercel with HTTPS support
